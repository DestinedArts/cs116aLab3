Lab 3 - Transformations


* operator overloading glm::mat4: glm library knows trans rotation scale matrix is 4x4
* glm matrix operators have more support in 3D than 2D
* glm has a matrix stack
* ofPushMatrix();
* ofMultMatrix();
* ofDrawTriangle(verts[], verts[], verts[]);
* ofPopMatrix();  // if do not pop, every triangle has same transformation

use simple numbers then scale up
